An excerpt from the Theory of Deduction section in the Principia:

“The purpose of the present section is to set forth the first stage of the
deduction of pure mathematics from its logical foundations. This first stage is
necessarily concerned with deduction itself, i.e., with the principles by which
conclusions are inferred from premises.”

I used the word "ast" to replace "*" and underscore "_" to replace
"·" in the Principia. For example, Theorem "*2·08" becomes "ast_2_08".

Any comment related to a specific theorem should precede the theorem and never
follow it. Quoted comments are those made in the Principia concerning a
particular theorem or definition.

Except for a very few usages of Mathlib's builtin logic theorems, this work is
expected to be self-contained­meaning that almost all of the theorems are
derived using previous ones.

--- *1.3 ⊢: p ∨ q . ⊃ . q ∨ p

--- “This principle states: ‘If q is true, then ‘p or q’ is true.’ Thus e.g., if
--- q is ‘to-day is Wednesday’ and p is ‘to-day is Tuesday,’ the principle
--- states: ‘If to-day is Wednesday, then to-day is either Tuesday or
--- Wednesday.’ It is called the ‘principle of addition,’ because it states that
--- if a proposition is true, any alternative may be added without making it
--- false. the principle will be referred to as ‘Add.”

--- ‘principle of permutation’ because it states that if a proposition is true,
--- any alternative may be added without making it false. The principle will be
--- referred to as ‘Perm.’

--- “This principle states: ‘If either p is true, or ‘q or r’ is true, then
--- either q is true, or ‘p or r’ is true.’ It is a form of the associative law
--- for logical addition, and will be called ‘associative principle.’ It will be
--- referred to as ‘Assoc.’ The proposition p ∨ (q ∨ r) . ⊃ . (p ∨ q) ∨ r, which
--- would be the natural form for the associative law, has less deductive power,
